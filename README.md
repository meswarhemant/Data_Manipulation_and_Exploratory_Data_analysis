ðŸ§ª Data Manipulation and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project begins with a structured approach to understanding the dataset using data manipulation and exploratory data analysis (EDA). These steps are crucial for identifying data issues, uncovering patterns, and preparing the data for analysis or modeling. Below is a complete breakdown of the process:

1. Loading and Inspecting the Data
The first step is to load the dataset and explore its basic structure. We check the number of rows and columns, examine column names, and review a few sample records to understand what each column represents. This gives an initial idea of the datasetâ€™s shape and potential challenges.

2. Understanding Data Types and Structure
We evaluate the types of data each column contains â€” such as numeric values, categorical labels, or dates. Correct data types are essential because they determine how operations and visualizations are applied. For example, numerical data can be summarized statistically, while categorical data may need to be encoded.

3. Handling Missing Data
Datasets often contain missing values. We analyze how many values are missing in each column and decide how to handle them. If only a few values are missing, we may fill them using appropriate methods (like average or most common value). If a column has too many missing values, we might remove it. The goal is to retain as much useful data as possible without introducing bias.

4. Removing Duplicates and Inconsistencies
Duplicate rows or inconsistent entries can skew analysis results. We identify and remove duplicates, and check for data inconsistencies (like different spellings for the same category) to ensure data quality.

5. Feature Engineering
We create new features from existing data to better capture relationships or improve model performance. For instance, if we have a start date and end date, we might create a new column for duration. This step is creative and often yields valuable insights.

6. Converting and Encoding Data
Some columns, especially categorical ones, need to be converted into numerical formats to be used in analysis or machine learning models. We also ensure that date or time-related columns are correctly formatted for temporal analysis.

7. Outlier Detection and Treatment
Outliers are extreme values that can distort analysis. We identify them using summary statistics and visual tools, and decide whether to remove or adjust them based on their cause and impact. The goal is to reduce noise while preserving important variation.

8. Univariate Analysis
We explore each variable individually to understand its distribution. For numerical variables, we look at measures like average, median, and spread. For categorical variables, we examine how frequently each category occurs. This step helps in understanding the basic characteristics of each variable.

9. Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis
We examine relationships between two or more variables. This helps us identify trends, patterns, and potential correlations. For example, we might explore how price varies by location or room type. This analysis can also uncover hidden dependencies or group behaviors.

10. Correlation Analysis
By calculating correlation coefficients, we determine which variables are strongly related to each other. This is particularly useful in identifying potential predictors for modeling and understanding the overall structure of the data.

11. Visual Exploration
Visualization is a key part of EDA. Charts, plots, and graphs make it easier to spot trends, distributions, and relationships that are not obvious from tables alone. They help communicate findings clearly and can highlight issues like skewed data, outliers, or clustering.

12. Final Data Preparation
After cleaning, transforming, and exploring the data, we finalize a version of the dataset that is well-structured, free of major issues, and ready for further analysis, modeling, or visualization. This step ensures that the data pipeline is solid and the insights derived are reliable.

âœ… Outcome
The combined process of data manipulation and EDA results in:

A clean, consistent dataset.

A solid understanding of variable relationships.

Identification of key drivers and patterns in the data.

A foundation for building accurate and meaningful models or reports.
